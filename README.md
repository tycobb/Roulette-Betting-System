# Roulette-Betting-System
This system is pretty simple.

You bet the column (12 winning numbers) which pays out 3 to 1.

If you win you go back to the mininum.

If you lose you double your previous bet.

So for example:
Bet 5 (min), lose
Bet 10, lose
bet 20, lose
bet 40, lose
bet 80, lose
bet 160, win.

Winning: +480 = 160 * 3
Losses:  -315  = 5 + 10 + 20  + 40 + 80 + 160
Total: +165

Another note is that this takes forever to run. Need to make it much more effecitent as I would like to run this simulation 500k times.
